Code cells like the one below have `In [ ]:` printed to the side of them and, when executed, a number appears inside of the brackets. ***To execute both Markdown and code cells in Jupyter, hit shift + enter inside of that cell***.

    "A key feature of Jupyter is that it integrates text (instructions/notes), code ***and*** output all in the same document. For this reason, many astronomers and data scientists use Jupyter as a sort of lab notebook rather than maintaining lab notes, code, and code output all in separate documents.

    "\n",
    "You should always keep in mind that ***cells within a Jupyter notebook can be executed and reexecuted in any order*** as this can sometimes get you into trouble. This feature is the reason why an executed code cell is numbered, so that you know what order the cells you see have been executed in. Cell execution is not necessarily linear from the top to the bottom of the document, but can jump around within it. Often, you will note a mistake or something that you want to try and will go back and change the code in an earlier cell. If you reexecute just this one cell, then any already executed cells that rely on variables defined in the reexecuted cell or its output will ***not*** be automatically updated.  \n",

    "For the purposes of this class, labs and homeworks should always be executable in a linear fashion, as you will be clearing all output before submitting them. You should observe the following \"best practices\" for coding in notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use descriptive variable labels (e.g. lum_stara = , mass_starb =) and create a new variable name each time you do a calculation. ***Do not reuse variable names*** or you risk referring to one thing when you think you're referring to something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Before handing in any lab or homework, restart the kernel with the menu at the top of the notebook and execute the whole thing from start to finish once, making sure that all of your code output is how you want it. Note that ***restarting the kernel will clear the code output, not the code itself***, so you will not be losing your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you note a mistake in an earlier cell and go back to correct it, you should be careful to also reexecute any later cells that depend on it. ***If you want to do a calculation similar to one that you executed in a previous cell, you should copy the contents of that cell into a new cell***, rename the variables, and execute it again.

In mathematics, the statement that a = b is a statement that two things are equal, and it can be either true or false. In python, as in almost all other programming languages, a = b means something different. It means that the value of the variable a should be changed to whatever value b has. Thus the statement we made a = a + 1 is not an assertion (which is obviously false) that a is equal to itself plus one. It is an instruction to the computer to take the variable a, and 1 to it, and then store the result back into the variable a. In this example, it therefore changes the value of a from 4 to 5.\n",

In mathematics there is no need to make the distinction, of course: all integers are real numbers, so it would seem that there should be no reason to have a separate type of variable to hold integers. However, this ignores the way computers work. On a computer, operations involving integers are exact: 1 + 1 is exactly 2. However, operations on real numbers are necessarily inexact. I say necessarily because a real number is capable of having an arbitrary number of decimal places. The number pi contains infinitely many digits, and never repeats, but my computer only comes with a finite amount of memory and processor power. \n",

    "Even rational numbers (like 2/3) run into this problem, because their decimal representation (or to be exact their representation in binary) may be an infinitely repeating sequence. Thus it is not possible to perform operations on arbitrary real numbers to exact precision. Instead, arithmetic operations on floating point numbers are approximate, with the level of accuracy determined by factors like how much memory one wants to devote to storing digits, and how much processor time one wants to spend manipulating them. \n",

Make sure that the notebook has run all the way to the end and that the cells still have sensible output. We can't grade things that don't compile. Once you're satisfied, click the kernel menu again and select \"restart & clear all output\" and then \"close and halt\" from the file menu. Then to shut down the notebook server, go back to the original window where you started things up and type ctrl-C. You will be asked for confirmation, and if you type y, the server will then shut down.\n",
